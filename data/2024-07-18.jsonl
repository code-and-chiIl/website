It involved playing recorded sets of words to patients who had implants that monitored the activity of neurons located in their left prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain largely responsible for processing language. The study found that the neurons' responses changed based on context - neurons in certain areas would light up if the patient heard specific words. Words presented with context elicited a stronger response compared to when the context was not available.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-07-18"}

It works by lowering levels of a protein called interleukin-11, which is associated with higher levels of inflammation and other factors that control the pace of aging. Mice with decreased interleukin-11 had lower levels of cancer, improved muscle function, were leaner, had healthier fur, and scored better on many measures of frailty. The drug is already being tested in people, but it is unknown whether it will have the same anti-aging effect.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-07-18"}

Compilers must consider many tradeoffs when choosing what optimizations to perform and how to perform them. Extremely sophisticated algorithms may be avoided because they can be expensive, too complex, or not broadly applicable. Hardcoded optimizations are fairly cheap and the maintenance burden is very low.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-07-18"}
