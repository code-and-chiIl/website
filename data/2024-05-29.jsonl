The 2,500-page document contained 14,014 attributes that appear to come from Google's internal Content API Warehouse. While it doesn't show things like the weight of particular elements in the search ranking algorithm or prove which elements are used in the ranking systems, it shows incredible details about the data Google collects. This article looks at the leak and extracts some of the most interesting details, for example, how Google utilized cookie history, logged-in Chrome data, and pattern detection to fight manual and automated click spam.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-05-29"}
{"title": "Will Scaling Solve Robotics? (15 minute read)", "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/solve-robotics?utm_source=tldrnewsletter", "description": "Over 900 people attended last year's Conference on Robot Learning, which featured 11 workshops and almost 200 accepted papers. One of the largest debates at the event was whether training a large neural network on a very large data set was a feasible way to solve robotics. This post presents the different sides of the argument to deepen people's understanding of the debate. Scaling has worked for other similar fields. However, it is impractical as there isn't much robotics data available and there's no clear way to get it. Even if scaling works as well as in other fields, it likely still won't solve robotics.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-05-29"}

The high density of electrodes allowed neuroscientists to map the activity of neurons at an unprecedented resolution during a surgery to remove a benign brain tumor. Precision's device sits on top of the brain and does not penetrate the brain at all. It consists of a film that contains 1,024 electrodes embedded in a lattice pattern. The device is modular, allowing for multiple films to be used at once - four devices were used during the surgery.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-05-29"}

Many programmatic API clients don't keep browser-like state of things like HSTS headers they have seen. The usability-security tradeoff argument doesn't apply as APIs are mostly consumed by other software. HTTP interfaces should be disabled entirely or return clear error responses for unencrypted requests. API credentials sent over unencrypted connections should be considered compromised and revoked.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-05-29"}
