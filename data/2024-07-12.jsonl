The hormone's effects explain how women's bones remain relatively robust even as calcium is stripped from their bones to support milk production. Mice with increased CCN3 had dramatic increases in bone mass and strength over the course of weeks, regardless of age and sex. The hormone can be administered through a hydrogel patch applied directly to the site of a bone fracture.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-07-12"}
