Tesla had 140,473 employees as of December 2023. Its shares have fallen 31% year to date. Electric vehicle sales are gaining popularity worldwide, but the company is facing more competition now than ever. It is also dealing with other challenges, such as logistical problems caused by Yemeni Houthi maritime attacks in the Red Sea and production suspension at its gigafactory near Berlin due to suspected arson at a nearby electricity substation. A copy of the memo from Musk is available at the end of the article. </p><hr /><h2>Cybertruck owners allege pedal problem as Tesla suspends deliveries (2 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-stops-cybertruck-deliveries-accelerator-pedal-may-be-to-blame/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Tesla has canceled dozens of Cybertruck deliveries due to an unexpected delay.

While the device costs around $4,000, more than 80% of the participants in the clinical trial said they would recommend the device to a friend with tinnitus. It is unclear how long the benefits last as clinical trials have only evaluated the device over a 1-year period. </p><hr /><h2>Introducing the Batch API (1 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1779922566091522492?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>OpenAI's Batch API helps developers save costs and get higher rate limits on async tasks such as summarization, translation, and image classification.
