Nuclear fusion experiment hits new record for magnet strength (4 minute read)", "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/18/wham-nuclear-fusion-experiment-hits-new-record-for-magnet-strength/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter", "description": "A new fusion experiment has set a record for the strongest steady magnetic field confining a plasma. Strong magnets are essential for certain types of fusion power - for every doubling of the strength of a magnetic field, the power output of one reactor design increases 16-fold. The team was able to produce a 17 tesla magnetic field, more than twice as powerful as the high-resolution MRI scanners used to image human brains. They are now working on more advanced magnet designs.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-07-19"}

The study, which involved scanning participants' brains with an MRI while under the influence of the drug, showed that the drug caused populations of neurons usually in synchrony to fall out of synchrony. The brain appears to respond to this by entering a state of enhanced plasticity that can last for weeks. The study hints at how psychedelic drugs could be used to treat people with addiction, depression, or post-traumatic stress.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-07-19"}
