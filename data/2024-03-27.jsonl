To be recognized as an AI PC, OEM partners must also provide a combination of hardware and software including a Neural Processing Unit (NPU), the latest CPUs and GPUs, and access to Copilot. It is unclear what OEMs will get in return for adhering to Microsoft's AI PC definition. Intel recognizes some laptops without the Copilot key as AI PCs due to their integrated NPUs.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-03-27"}

Apple has reportedly spent millions per day training its own AI models and it has been rumored to be courting news outlets for training content partnerships. The company may be planning a deal with third parties to supply cloud-based AI features. It may also be planning to open up an ecosystem for AI developers to create deep integrations into its devices.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-03-27"}

Its pilot carbon dioxide removal plant, codenamed Project Macoma, could start operations as soon as this year. It will pump hundreds of thousands of liters of seawater every day, splitting the water into acidic and alkaline streams using an electrochemical process. The alkaline outflow mixes with carbon dioxide in ambient seawater to create bicarbonate, a stable way to store carbon. While the impact of the plant will be small, the process, if scaled up, could help mitigate the effects of climate change.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-03-27"}

Scientists are exploring the many possibilities for new flavors and textures that can be made by modifying genes already present in fungi, as opposed to introducing genes from wildly different species. Researchers have modified a fungus called koji mold, usually used in East Asia to ferment starches, to be more meat-like, offering an alternative route for creating meat substitutes. The approach can create meat substitutes without the complex ingredients lists, costs, and technical difficulties of cultured meat.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-03-27"}

Google had a huge lead with AI in 2017, but it was OpenAI that ended up making GPT 1/2/3. While Google's team created Transformers, the company's internal processes made it difficult for its researchers to get work done. OpenAI was able to beat Google because it took big swings and focused.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-03-27"}
