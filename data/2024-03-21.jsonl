The new model will likely be a multimodel large language model with similar capabilities to GPT-4, but better. OpenAI is still reportedly training the model, after which it will go through internal safety testing to identify any issues before public release. Other issues, besides those that may come up from testing, may delay the launch.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-03-21"}

The field of aging has been debating how it works for decades. A new explanation for the phenomenon of aging called the 'information theory' postulates that aging is mainly driven by the loss of epigenetic information and that cells can be reprogrammed into behaving like their younger selves by reverting them to their pluripotent states. While the theory offers a path to reversing aging, there are still many challenges to overcome before the technology can be used - errors made while reprogramming cells can result in cancer and other major complications.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-03-21"}
