The personalized therapy, called adaptive deep brain stimulation, tailors the amount of electrical stimulation to each patient's individual symptoms. Patients note feeling the difference instantly and most say it helped improve their perceived quality of life. The study was small, but it represents a significant step in creating personalized treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-08-20"}
