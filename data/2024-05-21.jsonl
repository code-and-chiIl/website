Its new Surface devices, equipped with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chips, pulled ahead in tests against Apple's category-leading laptop. Microsoft's Copilot Plus PCs feature an improved emulator that can emulate apps twice as fast as the previous generation of Windows on Arm devices. They are equipped with a neural processing unit that can perform more AI task operations per watt than the MacBook Air M3 and Nvidia's RTX 4060. Microsoft's Copilot Plus PCs will hit the market this summer.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-05-21"}

Most of the threads implanted in the first participant have come loose and are no longer reading the electrical signals needed to translate his thoughts into cursor movements. While software changes have helped him regain many of the device's capabilities, only around 15% of the threads inserted in his brain remain in place. Neuralink's proposed fix for the problem that occurred in the first test participant involves embedding some of the device's ultrathin wires deeper into the brain.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-05-21"}

The process of detecting these signals is complex, and it can result in high error rates. Piping the output through a large language model resulted in lower error rates. The study showed that the parts of the brain that control the muscles needed to speak aren't picky about which language they're handling.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-05-21"}

This approach matches what venture Capitalists are looking for - it's an industry based on outlier returns. While most investments will fail completely, some will make a modest return, and a small percentage will be worth a thousand times what was paid initially - these successes easily pay for all of the other failures. The downside of early-stage investing is losing 1x your money, but the upside is that you make 1,000x - this is where you should focus your attention.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-05-21"}
