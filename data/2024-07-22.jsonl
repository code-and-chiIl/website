This article discusses some of the issues with the technology. Passkeys can't be exported, sites can discriminate on which apps and devices passkeys can be stored on, and they rely on more centralized systems. It's bad for society if only vetted and authorized entities can build passkey apps and it's bad for users if they can't choose to use a particular passkey app.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-07-22"}
