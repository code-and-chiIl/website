The selected GPT will have a full understanding of the conversation. Different GPTs can be tagged for different use cases and needs. OpenAI plans to eventually introduce monetization for GPTs, but the company may have to get traffic up first.

The device aims to layer apps and information over the real world, augmenting reality. While the device is amazing at times, it contains a series of large tradeoffs that are impossible to ignore. The device can be heavy on users' faces, messes up users' hair, and is more cumbersome to carry around than a laptop. After several days of use, this reviewer questions whether these tradeoffs are worth it. </p><hr /><h2>Researchers Approach New Speed Limit for Seminal Problem (4 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/researchers-approach-new-speed-limit-for-seminal-problem-20240129/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>The traveling salesperson problem asks for the ideal route through a list of locations, minimizing mileage. It is notoriously difficult, but a mathematical model called linear programming is able to approximate the problem as a set of equations and find the best solution. Integer linear programming (ILP) is a variant of linear programming that optimizes for problems solving whole-number amounts. A researcher from the University of Washington has combined geometric tools to create a new, faster algorithm for solving ILP in almost the same time as a trivial binary case. It is the first major improvement to ILP solvers in nearly 40 years. </p><hr /><h2>Why Farcaster Frames are important (7 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://blog.spindl.xyz/p/why-farcaster-frames-are-important?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Facebook's somewhat-forgotten Open Graph Protocol has been resurrected to power Frames inside Farcaster.

It will enable solutions to complex global issues, but also potentially lead to consequences as impactful and irreversible as those of nuclear war. While this is something the OpenAI board takes very seriously, the events in late November, which resulted in the previous six-person board of directors dropping down to one holdover member and two new people, are troubling. It is still unknown why the board did what they did. This article looks at the impacts of the November event and AI governance in general. </p><hr /><h2>Why the AI Boom is a Windfall for Tiny Anguilla (3 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-domains?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Anguilla is reaping millions from .ai website registrations. </p><hr /><h2>React Email 2.0 (5 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://resend.com/blog/react-email-2?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>React Email 2.0 features a re-imagined preview experience, massive performance improvements, new components, deployment to Vercel, and better support for monorepos. </p><hr /><h2>How to do things if you're not that smart and don't have any talent (9 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://adaobi.substack.com/p/how-to-do-things-if-youre-not-that?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>This blog post presents a list of things anyone can do to make meaningful contributions at work and do important work. </p><hr /><h2>The case for—and against—rapid AI-driven growth (14 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.understandingai.org/p/the-case-forand-againstrapid-ai-driven?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Human-level AI will likely have a huge economic impact. </p><hr /><h2>How to deal with receiving a cease-and-desist letter from Big Tech (16 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://12challenges.substack.com/p/how-to-deal-with-receiving-a-cease?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Anyone working with software that interoperates with Big Tech platforms outside of official APIs or services is at risk of receiving a cease-and-desist letter even if they don't see what they're doing as adversarial to the platform. </p><hr /><h2>ICANN proposes creating .INTERNAL domain to do the same job as 192.168.x.x (2 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/29/icann_internal_tld/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>The proposal means the new top-level domain may never be delegated in the global domain name system root. </p><hr />
