WeWork was once valued at $47 billion. It filed for bankruptcy last November, listing debts of over $18.6 billion at the time of filing.

The initial phase of the interoperability rollout will enable basic functionalities such as text, image, voice message, video, and file sharing between individuals. Advanced features such as calls and group chats are expected to be introduced later. The feature will be opt-in. Third-party apps will have to encrypt their messages using Signal's encryption protocol and meet specific technical standards. </p><hr /><h2>Bluesky is ready to open up (4 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/6/24062837/bluesky-drops-invite-system-begins-federation-at-protocol?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Bluesky is removing its invite system and opening its doors to anyone who wants to sign up. It will start letting outside developers host their own servers on its underlying AT Protocol later this month. Bluesky users will be able to opt into experiences that aren't run by Bluesky and bring their profiles with them to rival apps on the network. The company plans to make money by charging users for additional features in its app, taking a cut of purchases for things like custom feeds (which developers will be able to charge for), and through a service that will help others manage servers on the AT Protocol. </p><hr /><h2>It's Confirmed! Laser Fusion Experiment Hit a Critical Milestone in Power Generation (4 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/its-confirmed-laser-fusion-experiment-hit-a-critical-milestone-in-power-generation?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>A series of papers detailing the US National Ignition Facility's 2022 achievement of a break-even fusion reaction have passed peer review. In the breakthrough experiment of December 2022, lasers fired 2.05 megajoules of energy into a fuel source, which resulted in 3.15 MJ being released. Researchers have fired more energetic lasers and produced even more energy in several experiments since. Links to the five peer-reviewed papers are available at the end of the article. </p><hr /><h2>Mojo CSS (Website)</h2><p><a href="https://mojocss.com/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Mojo CSS is a framework for crafting UIs without shipping any CSS.

The most recent batch of data, released on January 18, shows a jump in the number of developers from Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Pakistan. The data only measures registered accounts rather than code commits, so it's heavily skewed to less active contributors. </p><hr /><h2>The Apple Vision Pro (28 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/the-apple-vision-pro/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>visionOS suffers from several UI shortcomings. It is difficult to manage multiple windows on the screen and its eye tracking is not nearly as precise as it needs to be for productive window management. The Vision Pro's field of view is very narrow, making it difficult to have more than two or so apps open without encountering z-axis issues. These problems result in the device not being a great productivity tool - better hardware may not change this reality. </p><hr /><h2>GFiber looking for external investment to expand to more cities (1 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/02/06/gfiber-more-cities/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>GFiber (formerly Google Fiber) is planning to raise external capital to expand.
