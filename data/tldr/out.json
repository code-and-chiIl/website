Alphabet shares jumped 55% last year and its revenue in the third quarter returned to double-digit growth alongside a rebound in the digital ad market."},

It can solve 25 out of 30 Olympiad geometry problems within the standard Olympiad time limit - the average human gold medalist solves 25.9 problems in the same time. AlphaGeometry uses a neural language model with a rule-bound deduction engine to find solutions. Its output is both verifiable and clean and it uses classical geometry rules with angles and similar triangles just as students do."},
{"title": "Meet Helios, a new class of space tug with some real muscle (2 minute read)", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/17/google-ceo-says-job-cuts-needed-in-2024-to-serve-ambitious-goals.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter", "summary": "Space tugs are miniature spacecraft that ferry small satellites to designated orbits. They are particularly useful for satellites that launch as part of a rideshare mission that seek to reach a different altitude or inclination than that of the primary payload. Impulse Space has built an in-space tug that can haul bigger satellites to more distant orbits. Helios is sized to fit within a Falcon 9 fairing and designed to fly on any medium- or heavy-lift vehicle to boost its capability. It will allow satellites to reach geostationary orbit within a day at a much lower cost than current alternatives."},

While these speed-ups are impressive, they're also misleading. The benchmarks compare against Pandas running on a single CPU core - while the Pandas library is single-threaded, fixing this doesn't require using a GPU. It also ignores costs - switching to a GPU may make things faster, but they are significantly more expensive. GPUs may still be an appropriate solution for some tasks, but it will require careful experimentation to determine if they are right for the use case and budget."},

While IPv6 is clearly a good thing, there are still challenges to switching to it. The biggest challenge to global adoption is ISP support. A lot of developer tools aren't set up for IPv6 yet. If you want to ensure your company continues to run smoothly after February 1, start making as many changes as possible now."},

This article describes to readers what the experience is like. The demo aims to walk through as many elements as possible in roughly 60 minutes, from face scans to the spatial desktop to movie watching, while unfortunately skipping over gaming. The author wasn't fully convinced the device was a compelling buy at $3,500 as the price is prohibitively expensive for the majority of people interested in the system and there is still a lack of Vision Pro-specific apps on the system."},
