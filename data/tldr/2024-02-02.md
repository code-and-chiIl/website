The tomatoes can be dried further after harvest to tweak their content, but that process doesn't involve the use of any additives. The dried tomatoes can be reportedly kept for a year after being frozen for shipping and storage without any negative effect on their taste, texture, or nutritional value. Supree will sell its product directly to corporate clients for now. </p><hr /><h2>For the first time NASA has asked industry about private missions to Mars (3 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/02/for-the-first-time-nasa-has-asked-industry-about-private-missions-to-mars/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>NASA is taking its first steps towards opening a commercial pathway to Mars.
