The 1,400-meter-deep mine holds the potential to store up to 2 MW of energy. Gravity batteries are charged by lifting heavy weights - these weights are then released, and energy from the drop is used to power a turbine. The technology offers a potential future for mines approaching the end of their original service lives. Studies suggest that gravity batteries in abandoned mines could store enough energy to meet global electricity demands. </p><hr /><h2>Momentary Fusion Breakthroughs Face Hard Reality (4 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-fusion-breakthrough-long-road?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>A new paper has confirmed the National Ignition Facility's claim that they finally achieved a breakeven fusion reaction. While there is still considerable work to be done, the achievement signals a major milestone in fusion science. It demonstrated that there is nothing fundamentally limiting scientists from being able to harness fusion in the laboratory. The team has since carried out six more experiments, four of which generated significantly more energy than in the breakthrough experiment. </p><hr /><h2>jQuery 4.0.0 BETA!
