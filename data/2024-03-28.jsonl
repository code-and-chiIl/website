Parts of the brain associated with memory and learning have also increased in size. It is unclear if larger brains make people more intelligent, but it could still be a plus as there are links to better brain health. Larger brain structures may reflect improved brain development and health. The percentage of people diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease has decreased every decade.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-03-28"}

It is unlikely to ever fully bounce back. Finding a good job is only going to get harder - the overall market might fluctuate, but there isn't much on the horizon that seems likely to turn the decline around. Effective documentation, information, and training will likely start getting harder to find, especially in areas where AI is even less effective than normal.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-03-28"}
