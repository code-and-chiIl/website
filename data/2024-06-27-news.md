The film uses AI-generated video clips to tell the story of the company's founder. Sora, which was introduced in February, is still not yet available to the public. The video required quite a bit of human post-production work to put together, showing that Sora is not yet a turnkey solution for instantly usable clips. The video, as well as behind-the-scenes footage showing how it was made, is available in the article. </p><hr /><h2>The brain makes a lot of waste. Now scientists think they know where it goes (5 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/06/26/g-s1-6177/brain-waste-removal-system-amyloid-alzheimer-toxins?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Two teams of scientists have published three papers that offer a detailed description of the brain's waste-removal system. Their research suggests that during sleep, slow electrical waves push fluid from around cells deep in the brain to its surface, where it is absorbed into the bloodstream through a sophisticated interface. There is growing evidence that the brain's waste-removal system is impaired in Alzheimer's disease - the new findings could help researchers figure out how to restore the system. </p><hr /><h2>If you're using Polyfill.io code on your site – like 100,000+ are – remove it immediately (5 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/25/polyfillio_china_crisis/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Polyfill.io is being used to infect websites with malware. Websites running any JavaScript code from the domain are advised to remove it immediately. The site previously offered code that added functionality to older browsers.

Most customers buy something they just want to work - configuration is a drag, not a desire. A company's stock product represents how the company thinks about its product, its customers, and the experience it imagines is the best one. Developers should be careful about the default paths that they choose. </p><hr /><h2>The A.I.

The work that consultants are enlisted to do varies from business to business and the results have been mixed. Many businesses have shut down AI-powered projects after experiencing too many issues, such as the AI giving incorrect information to customers. </p><hr /><h2>Nature published two papers on bridge editing, the new genome engineering technology (5 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1805996143228375263.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Bridge recombination allows scientists to write directly to the genome, inserting whatever they want wherever they want without making a single cut. </p><hr /><h2>Windows on Arm finally has legs (10 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186432/microsoft-windows-on-arm-qualcomm-copilot-plus-pcs-prism-emulator?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>The Windows on Arm experience has improved dramatically since the Surface Pro X was introduced in 2019. </p><hr /><h2>Google is testing facial recognition technology for campus security, starting at site near Seattle (3 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/google-testing-facial-recognition-technology-for-security-near-seattle.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Google is collecting facial data from its interior security cameras at one of its sites in Kirkland, Washington, to help identify people who may pose a security risk to its people, products, or locations. </p><hr /><h2>Stamp: a mini-language for project templates (1 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://scroll.pub/blog/stamp.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Stamp is a mini-language that makes it as concise as possible to write, edit, share, and expand project templates. </p><hr /><h2>Evolve Bank &amp; Trust has allegedly been the victim of a ransomware attack and data breach (2 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1805913148660084932.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Russian hacker group LockBit released around 33 terabytes of data from Evolve's systems after its demands weren't met. </p><hr /><h2>Contra Acemoglu on AI (10 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.maximum-progress.com/p/contra-acemoglu-on-ai?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>This article looks at the economic growth effects of AI and the differing views between academic economists. </p><hr />
