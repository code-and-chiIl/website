There is a near-total lack of moderation on the platform, making it a top tool for organized crime. Durov's arrest has led to widespread panic in Russia - Telegram is used by Russian forces to communicate, and Western intelligence services may be able to obtain sensitive information about the Russian military if they gain access to it. </p><hr /><h2>Boeing Starliner returning empty as NASA turns to SpaceX to bring astronauts back from ISS (5 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/24/nasa-boeing-starliner-decision-return-empty-spacex-astronauts-iss.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Boeing will return its Starliner capsule without the NASA astronauts that it delivered to orbit. The two astronauts will return via SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft on a mission launching on September 24. They will stay at the International Space Station for about six more months before flying home in February. The test was originally intended to last about nine days. This decision was made due to NASA's commitment to safety - Starliner's crew flight test faced problems, most notably with its propulsion system. NASA officials still support Boeing and Starliner will likely be able to launch with a crew again someday. </p><hr /><h2>China's own Tesla Optimus?

The show attracted 400 industry experts and academics and more than 160 domestic and overseas robotic firms. While there seems to be growing interest in robots from consumers, there are still several hurdles to overcome before their use can become widespread. These include a lack of sufficient data to train the AI used in the robots, limited use cases, and high prices. </p><hr /><h2>World-first lung cancer vaccine trials launched across seven countries (5 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/aug/23/world-first-lung-cancer-vaccine-trials-launched-across-seven-countries?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>BioNTech has begun trials for BNT116, an mRNA lung cancer vaccine, in 34 research sites across the UK, US, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Spain, and Turkey.

It aims to strengthen a person's immune response to cancer while leaving healthy cells untouched. The treatment is simple to deliver - patients receive a round of shots every week for six consecutive weeks and then every three weeks for 54 weeks. </p><hr /><h2>ruroco (GitHub Repo)</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/beac0n/ruroco?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>ruroco is a tool that lets users execute commands on a server by sending UDP packets.

(29 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://ryxcommar.com/2024/08/17/why-does-getting-a-job-in-tech-suck-right-now-is-it-ai/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>A lot of new CS graduates are finding it really hard to get a job. There is a massive confluence of factors, both on the demand and supply side of the market, that are contributing to it being harder to land a job in tech.

Clever and sophisticated beats basic and straightforward most days in the market. These products imply there is something special, which allows them to command premium prices. Tech companies tend to turn basic problems people could easily solve for themselves quickly and cheaply into challenges that only a sophisticated solution can solve - usually with a subscription. People can escape this cycle by deciding that all the extra complexity isn't worth it and daring to be basic. </p><hr /><h2>How Elon Musk Got Tangled Up in Blue (25 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/24/technology/elon-musk-twitter-blue.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Fk4.1xDk.P1Fhk-GoILM2&amp;smid=url-share&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Elon Musk thought Twitter Blue, which allowed die-hard users to pay for premium features, represented an untapped financial opportunity. </p><hr /><h2>Elon Musk says X staff can get their stock — if they prove they deserve it (2 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/23/24226830/elon-musk-email-x-twitter-stock-grants?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Staff at X will have to submit a one-page summary to leadership on their contributions to the company in order to get their stock. </p><hr /><h2>How we built Townie (18 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://blog.val.town/blog/codegen/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Townie is an app that generates fullstack apps. </p><hr /><h2>Create an internal CLI (11 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://blog.chay.dev/create-an-internal-cli/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Some companies use their own internal CLIs for org-wide things like installing useful tools, generating boilerplate code, or running complex AWS commands - this article discusses how to get started with your own CLI. </p><hr /><h2>CORS is Stupid (10 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://kevincox.ca/2024/08/24/cors/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>CORS is a giant hack to mitigate legacy mistakes, but none of its protections are actually sufficient to solve the intended problem. </p><hr /><h2>JS Dates Are About to Be Fixed (10 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://docs.timetime.in/blog/js-dates-finally-fixed/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>One of the changes coming to ECMAScript is a native object specifically designed to represent dates and times with their corresponding time zone. </p><hr /><h2>💡 Become an everyday genius with bite-sized, interactive lessons on your smartphone (Sponsor)</h2><p><a href="https://brilliant.org/tldrtech/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Master math, CS, and AI in 15 minutes a day with Brilliant — interactive problem solving that's effective and fun.
