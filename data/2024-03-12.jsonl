The device already offers a Conversation Boost feature, but Apple has not advertised it as a hearing aid device as that requires FDA regulatory approval. It is unclear whether Apple will need FDA clearance to make explicit or implicit claims about the 'hearing aid mode' or whether it will adopt that exact name. The FDA approved a new category of over-the-counter hearing aids called Personal sound amplification products in August 2022 that doesn't require legal registration by manufacturers or listing with the FDA. iOS 18 is set to be previewed in June and released sometime in September.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-03-12"}

The move follows Elon Musk's complaint that OpenAI has deviated from its open source roots. Musk has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI claiming that OpenAI, which was supposed to make its technology freely available to the public, has become closed-source and has shifted its focus to maximizing profits for Microsoft. Musk has long been a proponent of open source - Tesla has open sourced many of its patents. It is unclear what aspects of Grok will be open sourced.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-03-12"}

The 8 billion parameter RFM-1 can expand its abilities through more data consumption. It incorporates images, video, joint angles, force reading, suction cup strength, and more into its prediction engine to produce images, videos, or a series of commands for a robot. It can be used as a simulation tool, generating action sequences that are both realistic and accurate. With enough data, it could be a useful world simulation tool more capable than one built from the ground up. Covariant aims to make the model be able to do any task in any body.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-03-12"}

UB-312 is designed to clear toxic clumps of a protein thought to be responsible for the disease. It has been shown to be generally safe with relatively mild side effects. There are currently no treatments that address the underlying condition of Parkinson's. The therapy's initial success is exciting as it suggests that scientists are on the right path to finding a safe and effective means of improving quality of life for Parkinson's patients.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-03-12"}

Sharing early work can be daunting - it requires an environment and culture in which individual contributors feel comfortable bringing up unpolished ideas. Leaving technical reviews too late can lead to a lot of wasted time. Figma uses engineering crits to brainstorm novel approaches to technical problems, get feedback on the existing work, and unblock team members. This article talks about how Figma implemented its style of engineering crits and presents a template for other organizations to follow.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-03-12"}

These untagged unions often lead to cleaner user-side APIs that don't require boilerplate boxing up of values. However, if you have overlaps when using them, the result type might hold less information than you think. To get the composition to actually represent something like what you get with data types in other languages, make sure there is no overlap between the types.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-03-12"}
