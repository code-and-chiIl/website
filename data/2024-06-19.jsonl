This could result in a new generation of underground and underwater sensors that can provide location information without interference from weather and other obstructions. Their device could be ready for widespread use in just a few years. It works well in a stable laboratory environment but needs to be tested in more extreme conditions to be turned into a transportable, standalone device that can be used in remote or complex locations.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-06-19"}

The study found that level 4 AVs were over five times more likely to be involved in an accident at dawn and dusk and that the odds of an accident during a turn were almost double in AVs compared to human-driven vehicles. It highlights the need for better data and stronger intelligence for decision-making.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-06-19"}

Cognitive load is how much a developer needs to think in order to complete a task. Developers should constantly ask themselves whether they are embedding excessive cognitive load into their code as far more time is spent reading and understanding code than writing it. They should make things easy to understand to avoid creating unnecessary cognitive load for themselves and their colleagues.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-06-19"}

While creating a public interest internet would be difficult, the alternative, keeping our digital infrastructure entirely in the hands of a few megacorporations, could be more costly.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-06-19"}
