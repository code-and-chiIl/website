The strategy is designed to make the company's offerings stickier for customers. Nvidia is also building a business that supplies AI-optimized Ethernet, a business that is expected to generate billions of dollars in revenue within a year. The competition in the space is growing, with companies like AMD bolstering their data-center offerings and chip suppliers like Intel offering services and systems to help customers build and operate AI tools.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-09-03"}

While these deals may give the company access to APIs for more up-to-the-moment queries, the payments are more of a way to ensure that publishers don't sue OpenAI for the stuff it has already scraped. A lawsuit would be much more expensive for OpenAI. Its current lawsuit with The New York Times may end up costing it at least $7.5 billion in statutory damages alone.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-09-03"}

The hydrogel restores cartilage lubrication, preventing the progression of early osteoarthritis. It is comprised of tiny hollow spheres made of a biomaterial derived from natural protein and a synthetic polymer, the combination of which creates a favorable environment for cell growth and hydration. The treatment is able to precisely target small areas of inflammation. The hydrogel has shown promise in rat studies, outperforming traditional treatments in terms of reducing friction and improving joint lubrication.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-09-03"}

For example, people responded to improved light bulb efficiency by installing so many more of them there has been no decline in the total energy consumed by lighting. Jevons paradox, which describes this phenomenon, explains why efficiency improvements can backfire and cause the opposite outcome from what was intended. Autonomous vehicles promise increased safety and lower environmental impact, but Jevons paradox predicts that total crashes and emissions will likely increase rather than fall.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-09-03"}

This helps developers more easily prevent applications from overwriting any existing objects when uploading data. Conditional writes can be used to simplify how distributed applications with multiple clients concurrently update data in parallel across shared datasets. Developers no longer need to build any client-side consensus mechanisms to coordinate updates or use additional API requests to check for the presence of an object before uploading data. The feature is available at no additional charge in all AWS regions.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-09-03"}
