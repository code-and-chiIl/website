<h1>2024-06-17</h1><h2>YouTube looks to be testing server-side ad injection to counter ad blockers (1 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/06/12/youtube-ad-injection/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>YouTube is currently experimenting with server-side ad injection. It is making ads part of the video being streamed instead of delivering them separately, resulting in them being indistinguishable from videos. The implementation breaks extensions like SponsorBlock, which depend on timestamps to mark video sections. Server-side ad injection is still in testing and not yet widely rolled out. </p><hr /><h2>Sam Altman says OpenAI could become a for-profit meaning it could eventually IPO (2 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/sam-altman-says-openai-could-become-a-for-profit-meaning-it-could-eventually-ipo/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Sam Altman is reportedly considering making OpenAI a for-profit company that the current non-profit board wouldn't control. One possible option being considered is making the company a for-profit benefit corporation. This would mean the company will have to consider its impact on society and the environment and balance the interests of its shareholders with the interests of employees, customers, the community, and the environment. Becoming a for-profit could open up the path to an initial public offering that would give the public a chance to own its shares. </p><hr /><h2>‘Son of Concorde' company's superfactory will produce 33 supersonic aircraft a year (3 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://supercarblondie.com/supersonic-boom-superfactory/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Boom Supersonic's Overture airliner can reach New York from London in just 3.5 hours.

Texas offers lower taxes and a newer and less predictable business court system. The move will save Tesla about $250,000 a year in tax payments. </p><hr /><h2>We're about to learn a whole lot more about how the human body reacts to space (6 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/13/were-about-to-learn-a-whole-lot-more-about-how-the-human-body-reacts-to-space/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>A record number of private citizens are set to head to space in the next few years. </p><hr /><h2>Senior Engineer Fatigue (5 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://luminousmen.com/post/senior-engineer-fatigue?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Senior fatigue is a sign of maturity in engineering - it's an indicator that you're transitioning from doing everything to ensuring that everything that needs to be done gets done in the most effective way. </p><hr /><h2>Sleep deprivation disrupts memory: here's why (5 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01732-y?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>The disorganized sharp-wave ripples of sleep deprived rats seem to prevent them from effectively flagging experiences for long-term memory. </p><hr /><h2>AI Search: The Bitter-er Lesson (10 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://yellow-apartment-148.notion.site/AI-Search-The-Bitter-er-Lesson-44c11acd27294f4495c3de778cd09c8d?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Granting foundation models the ability to think for longer might upend Scaling Laws and change AI's trajectory. </p><hr /><h2>OpenAI adds former NSA chief to its board (2 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/13/openai-adds-former-nsa-chief-to-its-board-paul-nakasone-sam-altman.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>OpenAI's newest board member Paul M.
