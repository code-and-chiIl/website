It will shift some of the staff to work on generative AI projects while laying off others. Project Titan, which had been in development for 10 years, was originally going to be a car with a luxurious limo-like interior and robust self-driving capabilities. Its ambitions were scaled back after multiple changes in direction and leadership. The project faced high startup costs and a difficult regulatory environment, making it hard for the company to find the profit margins it hoped for.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-02-28"}

The moon lander's range finders were discovered to be inoperable a couple of hours before it was due to attempt to land on the Moon, so the company rewrote its software to take advantage of three telescopes on a NASA payload for altimetry purposes. While the patch mostly worked, Odysseus' onboard flight computer was unable to process the data in real time - its last accurate altitude reading was more than 12 minutes before touchdown. This forced the lander to rely on optical data, resulting in it coming down much faster than planned.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-02-28"}

Its centralized hiring process is completely divorced from the teams candidates might end up on. Interviews are conducted with people whom candidates might never work with again. After initial interviews, candidates will go through a team-matching phase, during which recruiters will likely down-level them. Candidates will then be made lowball offers with just a few days to make a decision. Meta will refuse to negotiate unless candidates can show other offers from comparable companies. This post shares tips on how to navigate the process and negotiate the best deal.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-02-28"}
