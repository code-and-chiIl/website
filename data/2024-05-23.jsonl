While the company was initially reluctant to let outsiders share the fruits of its investments or risk compromising intellectual property, executives ultimately decided it was better than letting promising technology wither. The new policy opens up more possibilities, but it also signals that Alphabet will be shutting off funding to more mature projects that haven't proven themselves financially viable.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-05-23"}

Employees who refuse to cooperate risk being locked out of future tender offers, stopping them from selling their stock. A company threatening to claw back already-vested equity is unusual. OpenAI's behavior towards former employees in the past suggests that the executive team knew about the provision.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-05-23"}

Devices that harness the heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements are known as radioisotope heater units (RHUs). The ESA has historically relied on the US and Russia to provide RHUs that use plutonium-238, but it has been working on its own RHUs since 2009. The European RHUs will heat components in the mission's landing platform, which will extend the lander's life, allowing it to become a backup power source in case there are issues in deploying the rover.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-05-23"}
