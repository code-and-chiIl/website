The deal isn't exclusive - Apple is already discussing offering other chatbots as additional options. Apple eventually plans to make money from AI by striking revenue-sharing agreements with AI partners.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-06-13"}

It can also perform sparse large language model inference at one-third of the energy cost of a full model without losing any accuracy. Both achievements are possible due to the interconnects and fast memory access enabled by Cerebras' hardware. Cerebras is looking to extend the applications of its wafer-scale engine to a larger class of problems, including molecular dynamics simulations of biological processes and simulations of airflow around vehicles.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-06-13"}
