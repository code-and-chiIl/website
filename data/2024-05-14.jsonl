It will roll out over the next few weeks for free to ChatGPT users and as a service through API. Paid subscribers will have five times the rate limits of free users. The API will feature twice the speed, 50% lower cost, and five times higher rate limits compared to GPT-4 Turbo. A 26-minute long video that introduces GPT-4o and demonstrates its abilities is available in the article.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-05-14"}

MIT engineers have engineered blood vessels to express a protein that causes them to dilate in the presence of light. This dilation can be observed with magnetic resonance imaging, allowing researchers to pinpoint the source of light. The new technique allows researchers to explore the inner workings of the brain in more detail than previously possible.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-05-14"}

Building an alternative implementation means reacting to the whims of the canonical implementation - they have control over the direction of the project and you can only keep up. It's better in most cases to make an original system rather than being chained by expectations to match another implementation.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-05-14"}
