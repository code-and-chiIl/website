The announcement appears to be an acceleration of the robotaxi program, which aims to design a vehicle optimized from the ground up for driverless ridesharing. Some Tesla owners are concerned with the project as it could result in Tesla focusing on achieving self-driving on new hardware rather than on its existing vehicle fleet as promised and sold to customers for years. A picture of an early design prototype is available in the article.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-04-08"}

Its goal will be to get Starship's upper stage to get through the high heating regime of reentry and make a controlled splat into the ocean. SpaceX aims to bring the Super Heavy booster back intact, having it land on a virtual tower in the Gulf of Mexico. It could attempt to land a Starship booster on the real tower as soon as the vehicle's fifth flight. The company is working to accelerate production of Starship vehicles to support higher flight rates and increase payload capacity.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-04-08"}

Most corals could go extinct within a few generations. The Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute's Reef Recovery Initiative aims to help save coral reefs using cryopreservation, a novel approach that involves storing and cooling coral sperm and larvae at very low temperatures and holding them in government biorepositories. The frozen assets can be used to help reseed the oceans and restore living reefs even 100 years from now. Cryopreserved sperm has already been used to produce new coral across the Caribbean.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-04-08"}

Before Stack Overflow, there was Experts Exchange, one of the first question-and-answer sites on the internet, coming into existence in 1996. Experts Exchange was free for over a decade, but it moved to a subscription-based model in 2004. This paywall created the perfect moment for a new site to counter-position itself, so the creators of Stack Overflow decided to create a more user-friendly version of Experts Exchange. Stack Overflow launched in 2008, the same year as GitHub, Apple's App Store, and Airbnb. The future existence of Stack Overflow will depend entirely on how well it can adapt to AI.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-04-08"}
