Google profits from both advertisers and publishers, pocketing at least 30 cents of each advertising dollar flowing from advertisers to website publishers through its ad tech tools. The trial is expected to last four to six weeks and may be the most consequential of the monopoly trials Google has recently faced.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-09-10"}
