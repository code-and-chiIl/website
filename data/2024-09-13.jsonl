The spacewalk kicked off shortly after 6 am ET on Thursday. The livestream showed tech industry billionaire Jared Isaacman leaving the SpaceX Crew Dragon and conducting a series of mobility tests before coming back after around an hour. The entire spacecraft was exposed to the vacuum of space during the spacewalk. The crew members were wearing SpaceX-designed and manufactured suits that were previously untested in orbit.

The model is better at writing code and solving multistep problems than previous models, but it is more expensive for developers and slower to use than GPT-4o. The release is still in preview to indicate how nascent it is. ChatGPT Plus and Team users should already have access to the model, while Enterprise and Edu users will get access early next week. OpenAI plans to bring o1-mini access to all free users, but it hasn't set a release date yet.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-09-13"}

Simply replacing small portions of a workflow with a button isn't enough to meaningfully change the work itself. The buttonification of AI is a reminder that we are still in the 'training wheels' phase of the supposed AI revolution.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-09-13"}
