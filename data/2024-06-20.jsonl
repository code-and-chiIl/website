Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI) has only one goal and one product: a safe superintelligence. Sutskever has previously predicted that AI with intelligence superior to humans could arrive within the decade, and that when it does, it won't necessarily be benevolent. This necessitates research into ways to control and restrict it. SSI has been designed from the ground up as a for-profit entity. It is currently recruiting technical talent in Palo Alto and Tel Aviv.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-06-20"}

(Hacker News Thread)", "link": "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40723302&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter", "description": "There was a lot of hype around building distributed systems using message queues in the late 2000s and early 2010s. That hype seems to have disappeared. One of the reasons for this is because most companies have realized that they're too small for these 'scalability tricks'. Bigger single machines being available for more reasonable prices means that companies are fine running on less hardware. Most companies are better off building well-componentized monoliths that they can break off into independent services later if there's a reason to do so.", "tag": [], "date": "2024-06-20"}
