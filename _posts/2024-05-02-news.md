These DERs help the grid by reducing or meeting demand through remote control so power plants can avoid having to burn dirty fuels during peak periods. They can also reduce the need for additional electricity grid transmission and distribution. VPPs provide a more predictable and easily managed way of helping the grid stay balanced. This article explains how VPPs work and discusses their future. </p><hr /><h2>Two giants in the satellite telecom industry join forces to counter Starlink (7 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/04/the-two-largest-geostationary-satellite-operators-will-become-one/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">ÎßÅÌÅ¨</a>  </p><p>Luxembourg-based SES is buying Intelsat for $3.1 billion.

It's all just computers and people. </p><hr /><h2>Google lays off hundreds of 'Core' employees, moves some positions to India and Mexico (6 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/01/google-cuts-hundreds-of-core-workers-moves-jobs-to-india-mexico.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">ÎßÅÌÅ¨</a>  </p><p>Google has laid off at least 200 employees from its Core teams.
