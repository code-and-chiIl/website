Everyone else was trying to build what they thought they could sell to advertisers or CTOs. </p><hr /><h2>😘 Kiss bugs goodbye with fully automated end-to-end test coverage (Sponsor)</h2><p><a href="https://www.qawolf.com/?utm_campaign=KissBugsGoodbye09102024&amp;utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=newsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>gets engineering teams to  </p><hr /><h2>DOJ claims Google has “trifecta of monopolies” on Day 1 of ad tech trial (3 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/doj-claims-google-has-trifecta-of-monopolies-on-day-1-of-ad-tech-trial/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>The US Department of Justice's next monopoly trial against Google started on Monday. The trial challenges the tech giant's ad tech dominance. The DOJ is arguing that Google broke competition in the ad tech space by engaging in a systematic campaign to seize control of the tools used by publishers, advertisers, and brokers to facilitate digital advertising. Google profits from both advertisers and publishers, pocketing at least 30 cents of each advertising dollar flowing from advertisers to website publishers through its ad tech tools. The trial is expected to last four to six weeks and may be the most consequential of the monopoly trials Google has recently faced. </p><hr /><h2>The College Dropout Who Invested Billions to Cozy Up With Elon Musk (12 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/entrepreneurship/musk-investors-spacex-ai-tesla-2711aca1?st=f1ppu6bt0em7md6&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>John Hering and Alexander Tamas' venture firm, Vy Capital, has invested more than half of its $8 billion in reported assets into Elon Musk's startups.
