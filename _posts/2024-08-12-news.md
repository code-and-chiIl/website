The new slim model is expected to be a bigger hit than the iPhone 12/13 mini and the iPhone 14/15/16 Plus. </p><hr /><h2>AI is mining the sum of human knowledge from Wikipedia. What does that mean for its future? (11 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://sherwood.news/tech/ai-is-mining-the-sum-of-human-knowledge-from-wikipedia-what-does-that-mean/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>The proliferation of AI tools means there's a growing disconnect between where people are getting their information and where it comes from.

Without clear attribution and source links, AI applications risk introducing an unprecedented amount of misinformation into the world. </p><hr /><h2>Novel Ideas to Cool Data Centers: Liquid in Pipes or a Dunking Bath (7 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/novel-ideas-to-cool-data-centers-liquid-in-pipes-or-a-dunking-bath-cdb7a393?st=5rm9dyl3gs2siq1&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Nvidia's upcoming GB200 server racks will be mainly cooled with liquid circulated in tubes. The company is also working on other cooling technologies, including one that involves dunking entire computers in a non-conductive liquid that absorbs and dissipates heat. Cooling accounts for a significant amount of power consumption in data centers. Liquid-cooled data centers would be able to pack much more computing power in the same space. </p><hr /><h2>621-mph maglev vacuum train "T-Flight" test successful (4 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://newatlas.com/transport/tflight-chinese-maglev-train-test-successful/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>The China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) has successfully tested its ultra-high-speed maglev train under low vacuum conditions.

While individual autonomy should be the main goal, local optimization doesn't lead to global optimization, which is what organizations should be aiming for. There are many legitimate times when administrative needs should supersede the individual. This article looks at when policies should optimize for the efficiency and happiness of the individual and when they should optimize for the team or company. </p><hr /><h2>What Google rivals want after DOJ's antitrust trial win (5 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/11/24216760/google-trial-monopoly-remedies-rivals?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>While Google has been ruled as an illegal monopoly, the Department of Justice has yet to announce what remedies it will seek. It has previously indicated that any remedies would be structural, meaning break-ups rather than mandates to change certain behaviors. Google rivals have suggested changes such as choice screens that pop up periodically, a ban on dark pattern popups that push people back to the default, and barring Google from buying default status or pre-installation and self-preferencing its own content in serve results. The final decision will be at least as consequential as the Microsoft antitrust case 23 years ago, which spurred an era of unprecedented innovation that allowed promising startups to flourish - including Google. </p><hr /><h2>Rise of the New York Tech Scene (5 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://newsletter.rhizomerd.com/p/rise-of-the-new-york-tech-scene?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>New York may become a place where technology is turned into end-user-facing products for an endless array of niches. </p><hr /><h2>pg_replicate (GitHub Repo)</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/supabase/pg_replicate?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>pg_replicate is a Rust crate for quickly building replication solutions for Postgres. </p><hr /><h2>Instagram is testing its own take on Snap Maps (2 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/9/24217027/instagram-snap-map-style-feature-testing?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Instagram is testing a new feature that lets users post text and video updates to a map based on where they were taken. </p><hr /><h2>How I Created 175 Fonts Using Rust (30 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://chevyray.dev/blog/creating-175-fonts/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>This article walks through the process of creating a toolchain for generating, quality testing, and deploying fonts in Rust. </p><hr /><h2>Software innovation just isn't what it used to be, and Moxie Marlinspike blames Agile (4 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/09/marlinspike/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Agile teams work separately from each other without much visibility into what other teams are doing, preventing them from combining engineering expertise. </p><hr /><h2>Perceived Age (8 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://suryad.com/blog/percieved-age/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>We perceive time differently as we age - learning new things and taking on challenging cognitive tasks can potentially slow down our internal sense of time. </p><hr /><h2>[Extended workshop] Trace your frontend issues to backend problems in Next.js (Sponsor)</h2><p><a href="https://sentry.io/resources/extended-tracing-frontend-issues-with-backend-solutions/?utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=paid-community&amp;utm_campaign=tracing-fy25q3-traceworkshop&amp;utm_content=static-ad-headshots-rsvp">링크</a>  </p><p>Back due to popular demand!
