While Apple was previously planning to drop support for progressive web apps, it now says it will continue to offer existing capabilities using WebKit technology, with no option for them to be powered by third-party browser engines. </p><hr /><h2>Dell exec reveals Nvidia has a 1,000-watt GPU in the works (3 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/05/nvidias_b100_gpu_1000w/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Nvidia's B200 AI accelerator will consume 1,000 watts without requiring liquid cooling.

It is possible to get serious work done while wearing the Vision Pro - if you can work on an iPad, you can work on a Vision Pro. However, it can't replace a Mac for everyone due to lacking some heavy-duty applications. One big downside is the lack of a practical way to use the Vision Pro in meetings. </p><hr /><h2>Nerdy internals of an Apple text editor 👨🏻‍🔧 (19 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://papereditor.app/internals?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>This article discusses engineering details behind Paper, a text editor for Apple platforms.

This article discusses the differences between training models at Google and training models 'in the wild' - outside of Google, where data scientists have to use GPUs instead of Google's TPUs. It makes comparisons between Google's infrastructure and tools to their equivalents in the outside world. With the right amount of brute technical strength, it is possible to train models from scratch that match Gemini Pro/GPT 3.5. </p><hr /><h2>Linux market share passes 4% for first time; macOS dominance declines (3 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/linux-continues-growing-market-share-reaches-4-of-desktops/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Linux reached 4.03% of global market share in February.
