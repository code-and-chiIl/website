Antitrust officials are concerned that Nvidia is making it harder to switch to other suppliers and penalizing buyers that don't exclusively use its artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia claims that its market dominance stems from the quality of its products. The company prioritizes customers who can make use of its products in ready-to-go data centers as soon as they're provided to prevent stockpiling and to speed up the broader adoption of AI. </p><hr /><h2>New forms of steel for stronger, lighter cars (9 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/technology/2024/new-steel-for-stronger-lighter-cars?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Automakers tweak production processes to create new steels that allow them to build cars that are both safer and more fuel-efficient. Most steel is more than 98 percent iron - it's the remaining amounts that make the difference. Modifying treatment methods can also change the metal's structure to yield different properties. This article looks at some of these techniques and the materials that comprise modern vehicles. </p><hr /><h2>SpaceX Polaris Dawn mission set to launch early Friday (2 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-09-spacex-polaris-dawn-mission-early.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>The SpaceX Polaris Dawn mission, set to feature the first-ever spacewalk by private citizens, is now scheduled to launch on Friday from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, with backup opportunities on Saturday and Sunday. The mission aims to reach a peak altitude of 870 miles, the highest for any crewed mission in over half a century. The crew will be wearing newly developed SpaceX extravehicular activity suits on their spacewalk. The launch was delayed twice last week due to technical issues and weather constraints. </p><hr /><h2>Greppability is an underrated code metric (5 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://morizbuesing.com/blog/greppability-code-metric/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Making a codebase searchable can make functions, error messages, class names, and other components easier to find. Splitting up identifiers is a bad idea because while it looks nice, it makes it easier to miss specific occurrences. Use the same names for things across the stack, otherwise, you'll have to make multiple queries to find all occurrences. Flat-named structures are mostly better than nested ones. </p><hr /><h2>Quick guide to web typography for developers (18 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://sinja.io/blog/web-typography-quick-guide?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>This guide covers key typography settings and teaches how to manipulate them with CSS to make texts on apps and websites look good by default. It is designed to help developers get good results without diving headfirst into typography. The guide focuses on general adjustments that make text good-looking and easy to read and the CSS rules needed to achieve that. Experienced designers shouldn't be afraid to break the rules, but developers should probably stick to sensible defaults if they're not sure. </p><hr /><h2>✂️ Cut your QA cycles down from hours to minutes (Sponsor)</h2><p><a href="https://www.qawolf.com/?utm_campaign=ScaleAutomatedQA09032024&amp;utm_source=tldr&amp;utm_medium=newsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>If slow QA processes bottleneck you or your software engineering team and you're releasing slower because of it — you need to check out QA Wolf. </p><hr /><h2>Tesla will need some Hollywood magic for its robotaxi reveal (7 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234785/tesla-robotaxi-event-warner-bros-mapping-data-musk?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Tesla will likely reveal its long-awaited autonomous robotaxi at the Warner Bros. movie studio in Los Angeles at an event on October 10. The 110-acre lot contains fake suburban towns, which could be an ideal location to test the technology. The company has been collecting data in the area to help its demonstration perform flawlessly. This approach suggests that the technology is still far away from true Level 5 autonomy and restrained by geographic limitations. </p><hr /><h2>Intel reveals first Lunar Lake laptop CPUs: everything you need to know (9 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24233957/intel-lunar-lake-core-ultra-200v-launch?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Intel's new Core Ultra 200V lineup, formerly known as Lunar Lake, claims to beat Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and AMD Strix Point laptop chips in almost every way.
