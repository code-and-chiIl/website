The ads display a countdown timer and stop users from being able to browse through more content on the app until they view the ad.

The majority of reactions to the feature have been negative. </p><hr /><h2>The Opaque Investment Empire Making OpenAI's Sam Altman Rich (19 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-sam-altman-investments-004fc785?st=wweh4f750w9e3ty&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Sam Altman is one of Silicon Valley's most prolific and aggressive individual investors.

Our data-centric way of seeing the world isn't serving us well. Tools are controlled by human users, whereas machines only do what their designers want. Technologists should build tools rather than machines. Seeing like a data structure is a choice and there are different paths we can take. </p><hr /><h2>The End of Software (3 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/103cGe8qixC7ZzFsRu5Ww2VEW5YgH9zQaiaqbBsZ1lcc/edit?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Media behaved very differently before the internet. It was expensive to create and distribute. The internet reduced the cost of creating content to zero, allowing a lot of user generated content to be created as creating content didn't cost anything anymore. Content behaved differently once it no longer had to make money. Software is expensive because developers are expensive. Large language models could drive the cost of creating software to zero - this will likely result in a Cambrian explosion of software, similar to what happened with content. </p><hr /><h2>Palmer Luckey is now selling pixel-perfect ultrabright magnesium Game Boys for $199 (6 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170572/modretro-chromatic-game-boy-color-palmer-luckey-price-release-date?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>The ModRetro Chromatic features a magnesium alloy case, sapphire crystal cover glass, PBT buttons, a pixel-perfect IPS screen, and a screen capable of well over a thousand nits of brightness. </p><hr /><h2>Why YC went to DC (4 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/why-yc-went-to-dc?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Y Combinator president Garry Tan went to DC to start engaging policymakers and to be the voice of little tech. </p><hr /><h2>In Defense of the New (11 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.greaterstill.blog/p/in-defense-of-the-new?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Technology gives individuals choice and control - it is enabling people to move to more attractive places and create entirely new communities. </p><hr /><h2>Why I retired from the tech crusades (4 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-i-retired-from-the-tech-crusades-107a51ea?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>It's possible to attract people who aren't happy with their current circumstances to give an alternative a chance if you simply show how it works and allow them to conclude by themselves what the better choice is. </p><hr /><h2>Intel details new Lunar Lake CPUs to fight off AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple (9 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/intels-new-lunar-lake-chips-promise-big-gpu-and-npu-upgrades-minor-cpu-boosts/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Intel's Lunar Lake CPUs will feature a neural processing unit that meets Microsoft's Copilot+ PC requirements, upgraded architectures for its P-cores and E-cores, next-generation GPU architectures, and some packaging changes. </p><hr /><h2>Synthetic Plugs Could Reduce Need for Total Knee Replacements (3 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.technologynetworks.com/tn/news/synthetic-plugs-could-reduce-need-for-total-knee-replacements-387340?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Synthetic cartilage-capped regenerative osteochondral plugs can be implanted with existing surgical tools and protocols, do not require pre-loading with cells or growth factors to induce healing, and provide immediate support for joint function once implanted. </p><hr />
