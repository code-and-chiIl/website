<h1>2024-03-19</h1><h2>Apple’s AI ambitions could include Google or OpenAI (2 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24104626/apple-license-google-gemini-generative-ai-openai-chatgpt?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Apple is reportedly actively negotiating with Google to bring Gemini's generative AI technology to iOS. The company is aiming to release AI features to customers later this year. These features will likely be powered by a mix of first- and third-party AI models. While Apple has been testing its own in-house models, its AI tech is said to be less advanced than the competition. </p><hr /><h2>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announces new AI chips: ‘We need bigger GPUs’ (7 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/18/nvidia-announces-gb200-blackwell-ai-chip-launching-later-this-year.html?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Nvidia announced a new generation of artificial intelligence chips and software for running AI models during its developer's conference on Monday. The new Blackwell AI graphics processors are expected to ship later this year. NIM is a software that makes it easier to deploy AI. Nvidia aims to make all models runnable with all of its GPUs through NIM. NIM will make it easier to use older Nvidia GPUs for inference, allowing companies to continue using the GPUs they already own. </p><hr /><h2>A cargo ship’s ‘WindWing’ sails saved it up to 12 tons of fuel per day (3 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/windwing-ship-sails/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>The Pyxis Ocean MC Shipping Kamsarmax vessel features a pair of 123-feet-tall solid 'wings' on top of its deck to harness wind power for propulsion assistance. After six months of operation, results from its journeys show that the technology offers a promising way to reduce existing vessels' emissions. The ship reportedly saved an average of 3.3 tons of fuel each day - it saved over 12 tons a day during optimal weather conditions. One potential issue with the adoption of the technology is the extra 125 feet of height added by the wings as they could complicate docking in many locations. </p><hr /><h2>A ChatGPT for Music Is Here (13 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.gadgets360.com/ai/news/suno-ai-music-generator-chatbot-powered-by-chatgpt-5261684">링크</a>  </p><p>Suno's AI model creates music from text prompts.

The components in the Vision Pro are still years away from fitting into a Quest 3's size, weight, and price. The Vision Pro is effectively a very polished prototype or a developer kit rather than a consumer product. While it is an impressive piece of technology, there's not much that people can do with it. The future of computing probably isn't more or bigger screens. It may take a few years before the technology really takes off. </p><hr /><h2>OpenAI, GPT-5, Sora, Board Saga, Elon Musk, Ilya, Power &amp; AGI (2 hour read)</h2><p><a href="https://lexfridman.com/sam-altman-2-transcript?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Sam Altman recently appeared on a podcast where he discussed OpenAI, GPT-5, Sora, the board saga, Elon Musk, and more.
