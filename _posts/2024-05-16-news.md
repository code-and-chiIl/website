Superconductors offer the possibility of drastically lower energy consumption as they do not dissipate energy when passing a current. While they require cryogenic temperatures to work, they offer many benefits like zero-resistance interconnects, digital logic built on ultrashort pulses that require minimal energy, and the capacity for incredible computing density due to easy 3D chip stacking. Superconducting computers can be more power efficient than their classical cousins at large scales. </p><hr /><h2>Quary (GitHub Repo)</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/quarylabs/quary?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Quary is an open source business intelligence tool for engineers.
