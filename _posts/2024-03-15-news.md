This could result in an alternative for insulin production. The process involves inserting human DNA coding for insulin into cow embryos. It could dramatically simplify the process and cost of producing the drug. A single cow can produce enough milk every day to supply thousands of type 1 diabetes patients with their daily insulin for an entire month. Scaling up production, ensuring the health and welfare of the transgenic cows, and navigating regulatory approvals are still huge challenges that lie ahead before the process can replace conventional methods of insulin production. </p><hr /><h2>Evo: DNA foundation modeling from molecular to genome scale (9 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://arc-website-git-foundation-model-tool-arc-institute.vercel.app/news/blog/evo?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Evo is a long-context biological foundation model capable of both prediction tasks and generative design, from molecular to whole genome scale. The model generalizes across the fundamental languages of biology, DNA, RNA, and proteins to generate DNA sequences using a context length of 131k tokens. It is based on StripedHyena, a deep signal processing architecture designed to improve efficiency and quality over prevailing Transformer architecture. A playground is available where users can generate DNA in their browsers using Evo. </p><hr /><h2>Falsehoods programmers believe about time zones (10 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.zainrizvi.io/blog/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time-zones/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Building a time zone conversion layer on top of a datetime library sounds like an easy task, but it isn't. This article lists 21 misconceptions about time zones the author had before attempting to write a time zone conversion app as well as extra misconceptions from readers. These misconceptions include thinking that there are more countries in the world than time zones, that every time zone has exactly one agreed-upon name, or that time zones are always offset from UTC by an integer number of hours. </p><hr /><h2>HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 explained (25 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://alexandrehtrb.github.io/posts/2024/03/http2-and-http3-explained/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>The first HTTP draft had only one method, GET - there were no headers or status codes, and the only data format available was HTML. The protocol has evolved significantly since then. HTTP/3 is designed for unstable connections, resulting in performance tradeoffs. HTTP/2 offers better performance on reliable and stable connections than HTTP/3. Servers can accept both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 connections so clients can make the decision of which version to use. </p><hr /><h2>The Top 100 Gen AI Consumer Apps (11 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://a16z.com/100-gen-ai-apps/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>AI-native products and companies are growing faster and engaging users more deeply than ever before. Over the coming decade, AI will likely underpin category-defining companies.
