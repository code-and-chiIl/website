The only way for them to realize any value from this equity in the near term is through secondary stock sales. OpenAI has told employees that it will try to hold one tender offer roughly every year depending on how both the company and the market are faring at the time. Current and former employees are increasingly concerned about access to liquidity after reports that the company has the power to claw back vested equity. The company has used aggressive tactics to get employees to sign exit agreements that affect the future of their stock holdings. </p><hr /><h2>Stoke Space ignites its ambitious main engine for the first time (3 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/06/stoke-space-ignites-its-ambitious-main-engine-for-the-first-time/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Stoke Space has fired its first stage rocket engine for the first time, briefly igniting it for about two seconds.

Eli Lilly, the company that makes the drug, has submitted the results of its study to the Food and Drug Administration, which is expected to make a decision on the drug by the end of the year. The drug is still not a cure - its benefits amount to only about a seven-month delay in the loss of memory and thinking. The drug caused dangerous swelling or bleeding in the brain in about 25% of patients. </p><hr /><h2>Generative AI Is Not Going To Build Your Engineering Team For You (27 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/06/10/generative-ai-is-not-going-to-build-your-engineering-team-for-you/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Software is an apprenticeship industry - you can only learn by doing. The industry changes fast, so developers have to keep learning. It takes many years to forge a competent software engineer. Senior software engineers don't only write code - they have to be able to understand, maintain, explain, and manage a large body of software in production over time and translate business needs into technical implementation. Writing code is the easiest part of software engineering, and it's getting easier every day. AI can help generate lots of code really fast, but it can't aid in the work of managing, understanding, or operating that code. Generated code can't be trusted - it needs to be reviewed before it can be committed and shipped to production. </p><hr /><h2>Oracle Java police start knocking on Fortune 200's doors for first time (3 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/10/fortune_200_oracle_java_audit/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Oracle has dispatched Java audit letters to Fortune 200 companies for the first time. The company announced a new licensing regime in January 2023 that was two to five times more expensive for businesses with limited Java use. Companies should be wary, evaluate their positions, and only pay for Java where necessary. Signing up for a long-term agreement may hold customers hostage to fortune when it comes to renewal. </p><hr /><h2>The Vote on Elon Musk's $46 Billion Pay Package Is Coming Down to the Wire (4 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/c-suite/the-vote-on-elon-musks-46-billion-pay-package-is-coming-down-to-the-wire-70dd96eb?st=jmc1iutwgj7pogg&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&amp;utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>The vote on Elon Musk's $46 billion Tesla pay package is still too close to call. Shareholders are expected to finish voting on Thursday. Musk has been personally campaigning for the vote, even attending meetings with some large investors that he usually skips. To incentivize voting, Tesla has been offering a raffle for a chance of a tour of its Texas production plant with Musk. It launched a video with voting instructions last week that featured its Optimus humanoid robot. </p><hr /><h2>Ask HN: What are your personal red flags when you're interviewing at a company?
