The feature marks a shift from TikTok's original format. While the company rose to popularity due to its short-form video format, it has been slowly embracing long-form content to compete with YouTube. The platform has also been testing a horizontal full-screen mode and video-scrubbing thumbnails. It is unclear if or when TikTok plans to launch the 60-minute video upload option widely. </p><hr /><h2>Femtosecond Lasers Create 3-D Midair Plasma Displays You Can Touch (3 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/femtosecond-lasers-create-3d-midair-plasma-displays-you-can-touch?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Laser-induced plasma displays ionize air molecules to create glowing points of light. Japanese researchers have created a laser plasma display that is safe to touch. It uses femtosecond lasers, which create a pulse duration so minuscule that it doesn't result in any appreciable skin damage unless fired at the same spot at one shot per millisecond for a duration of 2,000 milliseconds. Touching the plasma produces a physical sensation, as if the light has a physical substance. The displays are still very small, but researchers suggest that it is possible to scale them with different optical devices. A video explaining the system and showing holograms generated by the display being touched is available in the article. </p><hr /><h2>The Longest Clinical Trial Yet Of Blockbuster Weight Loss Drug Wegovy Reveals Significant Side Effects (2 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.inverse.com/health/semaglutide-wegovy-clinical-trial?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>A study on semaglutide that assessed around 17,600 adults in multiple countries from 2018 to 2021 found that participants lost an average of 10% of their body weight. 17% of the participants left the trial due to side effects that included nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and constipation, which were most often felt during the initial months of treatment. The drug reduced major cardiovascular events by 20% - this effect was evident even in participants who didn't lose weight. The study suggests the drug could be potentially used for other purposes and could help make a case for more widespread insurance. </p><hr /><h2>React Compiler (9 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>React Compiler is an experimental compiler that automatically optimizes React apps.

Democratic decision-making never existed in the open source world. The majority of open source projects are run by a small group of core contributors who advance the project, review patches, and guard the integrity of the vision. Open source is first and foremost a method of collaboration between programmers who show up to do the work. It is not a program for users to get free stuff or a seat at the table where decisions are made. </p><hr /><h2>The Maker of Stable Diffusion Is Collapsing, Considering Sale (2 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/stability-ai-collapsing-considering-sale?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Stability AI is in big financial trouble and is in talks to be sold off.
