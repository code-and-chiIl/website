Many other companies are struggling to restore in-person work. </p><hr /><h2>Anthropic has a fast new AI model — and a clever new way to interact with chatbots (4 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/20/24181961/anthropic-claude-35-sonnet-model-ai-launch?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Anthropic's newest model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, is reportedly equal to or better than OpenAI's GPT-4o and Google's Gemini across a wide variety of tasks.
