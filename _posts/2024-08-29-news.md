SpaceX announced that Starship and Super Heavy were ready to fly, pending regulatory approval, on August 8. The FAA is still evaluating SpaceX's proposed flight profile. It is unclear how long approval will take, but the state of the launch pad suggests that the next test is still at least a couple of weeks away. </p><hr /><h2>AI Inference Competition Heats Up (6 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/new-inference-chips?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>The competition for AI inference is heating up, particularly in terms of power efficiency.

Instead of reading examples on Stack Overflow and adapting them to their particular case, developers can instantly get code tailored to their specific needs. It can make developers more efficient, but they need to remember that it is still a tool. It is important to always test the code it provides to quickly discover any hallucinations. </p><hr /><h2>State and time are the same thing (5 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/state-and-time-are-the-same-thing/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>State is time and time is state. The only way to see the passage of time is by measuring changes in observable state. Changes in state matter in that they create new times. If a state update is purely internal and cannot affect the observable state, then it doesn't advance time. This model can be used to reason about abstract systems. </p><hr /><h2>3 tips on developer messaging from a developer-turned-media-company founder with over 5 million subscribers (Sponsor)</h2><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dan-ni_as-a-developer-turned-media-company-founder-activity-7234621550853771266-skdO/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>In this LinkedIn post, Dan shares 3 key insights he's gained about messaging a developer-focused audience from building ScraperAPI and TLDR.
