(Lobsters Thread)</h2><p><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/0akqy7/are_there_any_good_reasons_use_c_over_rust?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>This thread discusses contexts where using C++ makes more sense than using Rust, things people new to Rust should watch out for when starting new projects, and things that those considering making Rust their go-to language should be aware of. It increasingly looks like Rust can solve all of the problems that C++ can without losing performance while gaining better memory safety guarantees and better type invariance guarantees. However, there are still several reasons to stick with C++, for example, Q2 and Unreal Engine require C++ and platform support for Rust is still limited. </p><hr /><h2>Bluesky and Mastodon users are having a fight that could shape the next generation of social media (7 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/14/bluesky-and-mastodon-users-are-having-a-fight-that-could-shape-the-next-generation-of-social-media/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>A developer recently released a bridge to connect Bluesky's AT Protocol with Mastodon's ActivityPub.

The release appeared to be controversial - it triggered an intense debate on the project's GitHub issue page. Integrating the protocols together could mean that users' posts show up in places they didn't anticipate. The way that these protocols interact with one another could set the stage for the next era of the internet. </p><hr /><h2>Apple confirms it’s breaking iPhone web apps in the EU on purpose (5 minute read)</h2><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/15/apple-confirms-its-breaking-iphone-web-apps-in-the-eu-on-purpose/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">링크</a>  </p><p>Apple says it broke progressive web apps (PWAs) in the iOS 17.4 beta due to complexities involved with the Digital Markets Act's requirement to allow different browser engines.
